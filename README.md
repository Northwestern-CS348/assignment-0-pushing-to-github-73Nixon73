# Pushing to GitHub

The objective of this mock assignment is to demonstrate the format of assignments in this course. It also ensures that you know how to submit an assignment through GitHub. 

## Format of the Assignments

Each assignment provides a task, such as implementing a search algorithm or constructing a module in an inference engine. To complete the task, you need to modify the student_code.py file to implement the required features. You may test your code by creating test cases that resemble the ones given in main.py. The feature requirements will be documented in README.md, such as this one.  

When you are ready to turn in your work, make sure to commit all local changes in your repo and push the commit to GitHub. The last commit we find on GitHub will be used for grading.  

To grade your work, we will run test cases on your code. The test cases used for grading resemble the ones given to you in main.py, though more comprehensive in assessing whether your work satisfied all requirements. To ensure that your code satisfies all requirements, we strongly encourage you to develop your own tests cases to debug your code before turning it in.  

## Task

Your task for this assignment is to modify student_code.py so when the function inside is called by main.py, it returns True. Please make sure to commit and push your work after you are finished with student_code.py.  

## Note

As with all future assignments, *only code in student_code.py will be used for grading*. Please do not remove or change the signature of any classes / functions in the file. You are free to add new functions and/or classes.
